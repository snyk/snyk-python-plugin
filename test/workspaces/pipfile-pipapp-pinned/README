This is a small pipenv-based config with all dependency versions pinned
in the Pipfile, based on pip-app.

This was created by running the following commands in a clean python3.6
virtualenv:

pip install pipenv
pipenv install -r test/workspaces/pip-app/requirements.txt
# manually empty the "requires" section of the Pipfile
pipenv lock
